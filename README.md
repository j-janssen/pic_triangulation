## The Milestones & the Three Stage Plan

The **goal** of this project is to get familiar with different kinds of programming tools and methods. 
Therefore an algorithm that approximates a given picture with one-colored triangles is considered. This project consists of three stages. First, the program itself(this will take most of the time) and then the accessibillity via web. Lastly, the app-version.

Here is a brief guideline with the **Milestones** for the first stage:  
* **The blueprint of the Algo** (Preliminary) 
    *  [x] Stepp 1: List possible algos that solve the problem!  
    *  [x] Stepp 2: Pic one by evaluating the pros and cons!
    *  [x] Stepp 3: Devide the workload into managable chunks/ blocks! 

* **The Awakening of the Algo** (Main Part)
    * - [ ] Stepp 1: Code in Python (version 1)! 
    * - [ ] Stepp 2: Code in C ++ (version 2)!
    * - [ ] Stepp 3: Use the C++ Code in Python via a library to speed things up! 

* **The Fine Tuning** (Finish)
    * - [ ] Stepp 1: Check possble problems.
    * - [ ] Stepp 2: Check possible improvements.
    * - [ ] Stepp 3: The final check!

## About the Problem itself

This section elaborates the problem mentioned in the introduction. As input the algo gets a picture (.jpg/.png). The output is again a picture (same size), but this one consists only of colored triangles next to each other such that it approximates the given one sufficiently. Down below you find some epic example pics (for these pics we used the uploaded algo-prototyp).
