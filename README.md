## The Milestones & the Three Stage Plan

This project contains various programming tools and methods. **Coding in C++/python**, **creating libraries** of C++ code for python files and using programs like **GitHub, VSCode & Jupiter Notebook** are a few examples. The problem is about approximating a given picture with one-colored triangles. To this end the **Delaunay Triangulation** and a **self-organizing map** (neuronal network) are used. 
Overall, there are three phases in which we proceed. Briefly, they can be described as follows: The first stage deals with the **algorithm**. The second stage involves the accessibility via a **website**. And the third stage is about a **app** version.

Here is a brief guideline with the **Milestones** for the first stage:  
* **Groundwork**(The blueprint of the Algo) 
    *  [x] Stepp 1: List possible algos that solve the problem!  
    *  [x] Stepp 2: Pic one by evaluating the pros and cons!
    *  [x] Stepp 3: Devide the workload into managable chunks/ blocks! 

* **Main Part**(The Awakening of the Algo)
    * - [x] Stepp 1: Code in Python (version 1)! 
    * - [x] Stepp 2: Code in C ++ (version 2)!
    * - [x] Stepp 3: Use the C++ Code in Python via a library to speed things up! 

* **Finish**(The Fine Tuning)
    * - [x] Stepp 1: Check possible problems.
    * - [ ] Stepp 2: Check possible improvements.
    * - [ ] Stepp 3: The final check!

## About the Problem itself

This section elaborates the problem mentioned in the introduction. As input the algorithm gets a picture (.jpg/.png). The output is again a picture (same size), but this one consists only of colored triangles next to each other such that it approximates the given one sufficiently. Down below you find some example pictures (given by the uploaded prototyp-algorithm).
